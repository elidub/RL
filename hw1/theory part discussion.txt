All Exercises and Equations come from RL:AI
Solution of Exercises are in [1]

1) Solution from Ex. 3.18

2) Similar to Eqn. (4.2). But how does that compare against the solution from Ex. 3.17. Shouldn't that be the same in someway? Or are they the same?

3) Part of the loop written below:

Loop for each s in S:
  Loop for each a in A:
    q <- Q^\pi(s,a)
    Q^\pi(s,a) <- ...

I would say implement Eqn. (4.2) on the '...'. But that does not correspond to solution from Ex. 3.17. And I would also expect that we are supposed to use our answer from 1).

4) Similar issue as 3)
